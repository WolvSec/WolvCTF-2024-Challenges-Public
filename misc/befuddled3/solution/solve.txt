`0_0$:,_`

Ok... explanation time.

Coming from the left...
`0_` just moves us to the right and is the beginning of the loop.

`0$` does nothing.
`:` duplicates the character, and `,` prints it. The character isn't 0, so the rightmost `_` goes left.

Coming from the right:
`,` prints the second character.
`:` duplicates the third character, and `$` drops it.
`0_` brings us back to the right.
