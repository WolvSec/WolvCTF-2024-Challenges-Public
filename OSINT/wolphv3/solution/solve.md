# Solve
- See in the discord that p1nesh4dow posted a picture of her apartment
![1](1.png)
- Look at sign that says "PINE RIDGE VISITOR PARKING ONLY"
![2](2.png)
- Search for pine ridge apartments on places like Google Maps. Can use the northern foliage, and the fact there's no front license plate to help deduce that this is Michigan, since most northern states do  require front license plates with the exception of Michigan
- Find the [location](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DjdgPRY7U2QMAvCM6) in Marquette, Michigan
- Accepted flags: `wctf{46.546,-87.389}, wctf{46.545,-87.389}, wctf{46.545,-87.388}, wctf{46.546,-87.388}`
